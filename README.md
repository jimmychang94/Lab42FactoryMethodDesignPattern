# Lab42FactoryMethodDesignPattern

## Summary
This is a sample of how a Factory Method design pattern works.  
While actual implementations of this design pattern may not have "Factory" explicitly in their class/name,  
all of them will have some sort of create functionality (hence its name of Factory Method).  

## Example
Here is an example of our code creating a resume and financial report.  
The resume uses a page type of "experience" while the financial report uses a page type of "Products".

3. Open the file "FactoryMethodDesignPattern.sln" in Visual Studio
4. Edit the example however you desire.  
5. To test, go into the "Debug" menu and press the "Start Without Debugging" option.
